  <h2>Method</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>STEP 1</h3>
      <p>
        Make the base: Put the flour into a large bowl, then stir
        in the yeast and salt. Make a well, pour in 200ml warm<br>
        water and the olive oil and bring together with a wooden
        spoon until you have a soft, fairly wet dough.<br>Turn onto
        a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until
        smooth.<br>Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can
        leave the dough to rise if you like, but it's not essential
        for a thin crust.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>STEP 2</h3>
      <p>
        Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic<br>
        together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room<br>
        temperature while you get on with shaping the base.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>STEP 3</h3>
      <p>
        Roll out the dough: if you've let the dough rise, give it a quick knead,<br>
        then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large<br>
        rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin<br>
        as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>STEP 4</h3>
      <p>
        Top and bake: heat the oven to 240C/220C fan/gas 8.<br>
        Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven<br>
        on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon.<br>
        Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season.<br>
        Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or<br>
        tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crips. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves<br>
        if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.
      </p>

  </ul>
